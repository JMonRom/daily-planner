# daily-planner

The goal for this assignment was to produce a web page where a user can use a daily planner that will save thier inputs and color code the time blocks dependent on in moment time. At the end the planner should be able to save user inputs in the local storage and display it for the user until it is reset.

## The Process 

The first step I took was working out how to display the date using the user's current day and time. For this I referred back to a previous activity that used 'moment()'. This was straightforward and done quickly. I also realized that the HTML page would be simple because the time columns would follow similar properties and the css page I noticed was a good reference for what I should include in my HTML tags for class and ID names. 

Then while I started working on the JS code I looked back at activities 21-24 to revisit jQuery and how I could use it when writing code.
